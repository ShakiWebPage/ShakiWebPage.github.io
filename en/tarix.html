              According to sources, the old city of Sheki, which was once 10-15 km south of the present-day city of Sheki, was built by the Sassanid ruler Gubad I (480-531). Later, Sheki became one of the largest cities in Caucasian Albania. The ancient Kish Albanian temple, considered the mother of Eastern churches, was located near the city of Sheki. On the eve of the Arab conquest, Sheki province was one of the 11 administrative provinces of Caucasian Albania. As a result of the Arab occupation, Sheki province was included in the third emirate. At a time when the caliphate was weakening, an independent principality was established in Sheki. After the collapse of the Hulaki state in the first half of the 14th century, Sheki gained independence along with the Shirvanshah state, and the Orlat dynasty came to power. In 1551, Shah Tahmasib put an end to the independence of Sheki. Sheki was united with the Safavid state.

                The architecture of Sheki in the XVII century was also of some importance. According to Evliya Chalabi, the beautiful stone fortress of Sheki was located on a hill. The fortress had two gates called "Shirvan" and "Ganja". There were 3,000 houses and seven mosques in the city, of which the Mirza Ali Mosque in the market square and the two mosques in the fortress attracted the most attention. The city had caravanserais, baths and a small market. It is estimated that 20,000 people lived in Sheki in the 17th century. Founded in 1747, the Sheki khanate was the strongest feudal state among the Azerbaijani khanates. According to the Kurakchay Treaty of 1805, the Sheki khanate became a vassal of Russia. With the Gulustan peace treaty of 1813, Iran - in other words, the Ghajar state, He officially recognized the annexation of the territory of the Sheki Khanate to the Russian Empire. In 1819, the khan's rule was abolished in Sheki. Instead of the khanate, Sheki province was created. In 1840, Nukha district was created within the Caspian region. The accident became part of Shamakhi province in 1846 and was renamed Nukha district.

                The picturesque appearance and diversity of relief of the current city have influenced the city's construction and building system. There is a distance of 450 m between the left and right parts of the city. Founded in the 18th century, the city was preserved until the middle of the 19th century, with no changes in its structure. Sheki is surrounded by green houses. In fact, the city of Sheki was a part of nature and was decorated with architectural works created here. It is based not only on a magnificent mountain landscape, but also on a plan that is in harmony with nature. In addition, each house is surrounded by its own garden and iron fence. The streets of Sheki are not built according to the proper arrangement of houses, but according to their own planning, and the houses are separated by fences and fences. Residents are typical of the feudal period, It was located on the basis of trade facilities operating in the regions, which in turn was reflected in the planning of Sheki. The names of neighborhoods and streets from that period are still preserved.

                The main factor influencing the planning of Sheki was the violation of the relief of the country. The streets were oriented and built relative to the foot of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. Many of the streets were built parallel to the relief of the northern plateau. The direction of Gurjanchay and Deyirman-arkhi rivers was taken into account in the formation of the central district and the main street. These and other features of urban planning can be seen in the 1862 plan. According to this plan, Sheki was divided into the following quarters and neighborhoods: Jackal gorge, Gilali, Demirchi spring, Ganjali, Yellow land, Room threshold, Aghvanlar, Duluzlar, Dodu, Gardeners, Sarkarlar, Dabagkhana, Taza village, Old village. The very scattered relief has hampered the development of artificial irrigation canals. Drinking water is taken from rivers. Sheki is supplied with drinking water by the Kish River and the Khinjali-Bakhlinsky basin. Shaki, which has a hilly and scattered relief, has divided the city into several parts and, as a result, created a beautiful natural landscape. The mountain scenery of the city makes it even more attractive.
