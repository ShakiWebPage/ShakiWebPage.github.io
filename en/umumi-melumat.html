                The coat of arms depicts an octagonal grid element reminiscent of the moon and stars in the middle against the background of the Sheki fortress. A white horse is shown in front of the network. "Shaki" is written in white on the silk fabric below the coat of arms. The tower and silk fabric are decorated with different shades of blue, and the network is decorated with blue, red and green colors, as in the Azerbaijani flag. The castle usually covers the main official in the coat of arms, as it is defensive in nature. The moon and an eight-pointed star are engraved on the Azerbaijani flag, which is reflected in the network element. The network element is shown as a symbol of Sheki, the land of artists. The white, royal horse figure is a symbol of talent, as well as a coin of the 18th century Sheki khanate.
